ðŸŽ® Roll-a-Ball (Unity Project)

The Roll-a-Ball project is one of my first hands-on experiences with Unity, where I created a simple yet interactive 3D game that involves moving a sphere around a plane to collect rotating cubes. While small in scope, this project played a key role in helping me understand the fundamentals of the Unity Engine and game development workflows.

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned

GameObjects & Components â€“ how every object in Unity is built from components like Transform, Rigidbody, and Colliders.

Physics System â€“ applying forces, handling gravity, and detecting collisions using Unityâ€™s built-in physics engine.

Scripting with C# â€“ controlling movement, interactions, and object behaviors through scripts.

Prefabs & Reusability â€“ creating repeating objects (pickups) efficiently.

UI Basics â€“ displaying score updates and game progress.

Build & Deployment â€“ exporting the project as a WebGL build to make it browser-playable.

ðŸ”¹ Why It Matters

This project served as my foundation in Unity development, teaching me the essential concepts I now build upon for more advanced projects. It was the first step in learning how to bring gameplay mechanics, physics, and interactions together into a working experience.
